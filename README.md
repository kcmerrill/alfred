## Installation
``` $ go get github.com/kcmerrill/alfred ```

## What is it
A simple go/yaml powered make file with a bit of a twist.

## Features
* Tasks can call other tasks
* Tasks can be run every `time.Duration`
* Tasks can pause or wait for an event to happen
* Tasks can call other tasks depending on success/failure
* Alfred uses go templates so you can inject variables making tasks reusable
* Common tasks can be invoked inside using alfred
* Common tasks will be stored in this repository for shared use(git, docker, mail, slack, etc ...) (Available ... more alwyas being added)
* Optional private/public repositories so you can share private tasks with coworkers
* No need to be in the same directory when running alfred if it's local, as long as it's in a parent directory
* Fire off multiple tasks at once
* Variables, regular text and command line evaluated


## Why
I have a lot of tasks I do daily that I'd like a remote repository to use. Not only can I update them, but others can also use it too. I love make files, but wanted just a bit more functionality while keeping it simple. I also love ansible but it's a bit too heavy handed for what I need, so this is my attempt at KISS.

## Example uses
* Monitor webistes with reusable tasks(see example)
* Setup/Update/Deploy projects in your dev env
* Start/Stop remote tasks
* Simple Nagios, Jenkins, pingdom replacement
* Monitor crons(alert on failures, update endpoints etc ... )

## Screencast
A video(~35 minutes long) showing alfred and how to use it. Using contrivied examples, I believe it should get the point across.

## Docker-compose replacement(as an example)
I recently used alfred to setup a process that cuts the time to download/lift/build containers literally in half.

## Example 1
Use alfred to monitor crons. Just wrap your command in an alfred task, and depending on success failure do something with it. In this case, we can use alfred to send in a datapoint to datadog

```
* * 1 * * alfred monitor python somescript.py
```

```
monitor:
    summary: Monitor a specific cron job
    command: {{ .AllArgs }}
    ok: success
    fail: failed

ok:
    summary: Send ok data point to datadog agent
    command: |
        echo "cron.{{ index .Args 1 }}.ok:1|c|#cron" | nc -w 1 -u 0.0.0.0 8125
    private: true

failed:
    summary: Send failure data point to datadog agent
    command: |
        echo "cron.{{ index .Args 1 }}.failed:1|c|#cron" | nc -w 1 -u 0.0.0.0 8125
    private: true

```

## Example 2
This example demonstrates the reuseability of alfred. This check is hosted within the common module `check`, so as long as you have the binary installed, you can tap into quite a few shared libraries. This is one of them. This particular module is dependant on another module, the `notify` module.

In order to use this, common module simply run the following command, replacing `kcmerrill.com` with your website, and your `supersecretkey` with a slack incoming webhook key/secret(typically the last two segments of the webhook url)

`alfred /http.slack "kcmerrill.com" "supersecretkey"` *10

`* optional int in minutes to notify intervals when the website is down`

By leveraging the common module, alfred will post into slack letting you know that your website is down.

```
http.slack:
    summary: HTTP Check
    usage: alfred /http.slack "website" "supersecretkey"
    dir: /tmp/http/{{ index .Args 0 }}
    command: wget {{ index .Args 0 }}
    ok: cleanup
    fail: send.notification
    every: 10s

send.notification:
    dir: /tmp/http/{{ index .Args 0 }}
    command: test ! -f last_notified || test $(find -amin +{{ index .Args 2 }} | wc -l) -ge "2"
    private: true
    ok: notify
    defaults:
        - ""
        - ""
        - "10"

notify:
    dir: /tmp/http/{{ index .Args 0 }}
    summary: Send slack notification
    notify: slack "{{ index .Args 1 }}" "{{ index .Args 0 }} is down"
    command: touch last_notified

cleanup:
    dir: /tmp/http/{{ index .Args 0 }}
    command: |
        rm -rf last_notified
        rm -rf index.html*
```

## Example 2
You can use alfred to get a project running. Useful if your projects have a bajillion steps, or if you're like me and you are typically responsible for dev enviornments at your work. Using alfred, you can run setup. In this example, we will use a common github module to clone a github project in a folder of your choosing, update all the submodules, create symlinks composer update and run version as the final check to ensure things are working.

```alfred common/github setup kcmerrill/yoda yoda```

We used common/github to clone the repository _FIRST_ then run alfred setup inside of it. This is useful because some projects are private and you do not have access to the alfred file like you normally would.

If it is a public repository, like `kcmerrill/yoda` is, then you can simply call it remotely. In this case, `install` is the task that will get yoda setup.

```alfred kcmerrill/yoda install```

That will seek out the project on github, look in the master branch and then call the `install` task within the yaml file. Which will then proceed to check out the code for you. Take a peek at `kcmerrill/yoda` for it's `alfred.yml` to see how it's setup.

## Example 3 (demo-everything)

    command: echo "See how it pops out from the rest?"
```

## Remote/Custom modules
In order to extend alfred to things out of the box, you can create your own modules. To do so, create an alfred configuration file. Here is an example:
```
$ cat ~/.alfred/config.yml
remote:
    kcmerrill: http://kcmerrill.com:8081/shares/
```
You can add as many remotes as you'd like. By default there will be one remote automagically added. `common`. A remote consist of a name, a forward slash and a name. If you're ok with having your custom work shared on github, you can setup a module repository.

Alfred comes with a really basic web server so you can host private/sensative modules on your internal network. To start the webserver you can simply: `alfred --serve --dir . --port 8080`. Note, `dir` and `port` are not required and default to `.` and `8080` respectively.

The folder in which you start serving your alfred files should contain a `modulename/alfred.yml` and inside the alfred.yml is your standard yaml file.

## Common modules

This is the `notify` module in action.
